# ðŸ”® The Crystal Index

[Live Site](https://www.crystalindex.co.uk)

A full-stack Next.js app, which is an index to record crystals, employing a Prisma as an ORM. Crystal information is created with GPT4. Location data is looked up and added using the OpenCage API. Location data is visualised with a 3D globe created with React 3 Fiber.

### App Overview

This app was created as a solution to document an ever growing collection of crystals which have been purchased from all over the globe as mementos of holidays, and then being a searchable database to rediscover old crystals or identify new ones.

#### Development Process

The most important piece of architecture to design for the app was the relational database models.
I wanted to record the basic information about the crystals alongside locational information not only about where the crystal originated from, but where the crystal was bought. This meant that a location was a database model which crystals were belonged to, by either origin or memento.

#### Functionality

##### Main Gallery

The homepage is a gallery view of all the crystals on the database.


This page includes a search feature where crystals may be searched by multiple properties including: name, origin location, memento location, colour and chakra.

##### Crystal Page

All of the information about the crystal is displayed on each crystals' page. This is where users can favourite a crystal, and if they are the creator of the entry, a user can amend information and see crystal properties which are personal to them, such as the memento location.

##### Create/Edit crystals

To create or edit a crystal, information is entered into a form, this form utilises different field types depending on the information required.
For the ENUMs (eg: colour, chakra) tag buttons are created to avoid spelling mistakes
For a crystals' locational relationships a location but already be entered into the database, for which the crystal is related to, to handle this data type a drop down list is used.

##### Profile Page

Every crystal a user has favourited is showcased on the profile page.

##### Location Page

Each crystal can be related to a location by either origin or memento; this is then visualised on an interactive globe.

### Challenges & Achievements

An achievement is storing images as binary arrays on the database, instilling a fast loading time for images, which will continue to increase in number.

## Future enhancements

The database needs to be fully populated with the entire collection of crystals, but this will be an ongoing process.

Another enhancement is to create an extra tab on the profile page for all the crystals which a user has created, so they may easily look at their collection and review the information.
